"""
Python module to read in DRX data.  This module defines the following 
classes for storing the DRX data found in a file:

Frame
  object that contains all data associated with a particular DRX frame.  
  The primary constituents of each frame are:
    * FrameHeader - the DRX frame header object and
    * FramePayload   - the DRX frame data object.
Combined, these two objects contain all of the information found in the 
original DRX frame.

ObservingBlock
object that stores a collection of Frames for all beams/tunings/
polarizations for a particular time.

The functions defined in this module fall into two class:
  1. convert a frame in a file to a Frame object and
  2. describe the format of the data in the file.

For reading in data, use the read_frame function.  It takes a python file-
handle as an input and returns a fully-filled Frame object.  The readBlock
function reads in a (user-defined) number of DRX frames and returns a 
ObservingBlock object.

For describing the format of data in the file, two function are provided:

get_beam_count
  read in the first few frames of an open file handle and return how many 
  beams are present in the file.

get_frames_per_obs
  read in the first several frames to see how many frames (tunings/polarizations)
  are associated with each beam.

..versionchanged:: 1.2.0
    Dropped support for ObservingBlock since the lsl.reader.buffer modules does
    a better job.

.. versionchanged:: 0.4.0
    Switched over from pure Python readers to the new C-base Go Fast! readers.
