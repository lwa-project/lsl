"""
Python module to reading in data from both 12-bit and 4-bit TBW files.  TBW data
consist of a time series of real valued data sampled at f\ :sub:`S` (196 MHz)
from all antennas in the array.  The stand numbering is based on the input into
the digital system rather than the stand number in the array.  The data are
divided into packets that contain either 400 samples (12-bit data) or 1200
samples (4-bit data) per stand per polarization.

This module defines the following classes for storing the TBW data found in
a file:

Frame
  object that contains all data associated with a particular TBW frame.  The 
  primary consituents of each frame are:
    * FrameHeader - the TBW frame header object and
    * FramePayload   - the TBW frame data object.  
Combined, these two objects contain all of the information found in the 
original TBW frame.

The functions defined in this module fall into two class:
  1. convert a frame in a file to a Frame object and
  2. describe the format of the data in the file.

For reading in data, use the read_frame function.  It takes a python file-
handle as an input and returns a fully-filled Frame object.  read_frame 
is designed to work with both 4-bit and 12-bit observations.

For describing the format of data in the file, two function are provided:

get_data_bits
  read in the first frame of an open file handle and return whether or not 
  the data is 12 or 4-bit

get_frames_per_obs
  read in the first several frames to see how many stands are found in the 
  data.
.. note::
    This function is a little flaky on TBW data sets that have less 
    than a full complement or 12M (36M) samples.

.. versionchanged:: 0.4.0
    Switched over from pure Python readers to the new C-base Go Fast! readers.
